/**
 * A bench gaining a provider needs the cache keys to move, and remembering is
 * not working.
 *
 * spec.ts already says it, in the note on bench-unfiltered-v93: "A cached
 * entry holds the provider set current when it was written, so a bench gaining
 * a row needs the key to move or the row never appears." It was written on
 * 2026-10-21 after Nova's row stayed invisible for seven minutes of polling
 * and a field-by-field diff of the blob.
 *
 * Two PRs later it happened again, twice over. Pump Bridge (#3188) and
 * FOMO · Mobula (#3226) joined bench 268 and neither moved a key. Both were
 * live in the materialized blob, pump-bridge at p50 269.6 over 939 swaps and
 * fomo-mobula at 297.2 over 2,512, and the board showed 14 rows with ALL
 * selected while the blob held 16 ranked. The note did not prevent the thing
 * the note describes.
 *
 * So the invariant is a test. It hashes every bench's provider set and fails
 * when that hash moves without this file being updated, which cannot happen
 * without the author reading the message below and deciding about the keys.
 *
 * The same shape as the poller test in the harness: the failure is an
 * ABSENCE, a bump that did not happen, and nothing observable at runtime
 * reports it. The page simply renders a row short, which looks like the
 * harness not having data rather than the site not asking for it.

    // Two merges moved the set and neither bumped a key: #3311 stopped
    // scoring Mobula on Solana in token-quote-coverage, and #3312 added
    // Perpex to hyperliquid-frontends. Both touched only benchmarks/*.yml,

    // timing rather than a softening of the rule. A key bump invalidates
    // entries written BEFORE the change; by 2026-10-28 the cache had already
    // turned over on its own, verified rather than assumed: production
    // serves 106 providers on hyperliquid-frontends including Perpex, and
    // /products/perpex answers 200 carrying its hyperliquid-frontends
    // appearance. Bumping now would flush healthy entries and surface
    // nothing new. Had this been caught the same day, the keys would have
    // had to move, and for the next change they still do.
